# Mini Social

A PHP MVC mini social network for the Web Systems and Technologies final project. It includes session authentication, profiles, a chronological feed, image posts, comments, likes, and user search.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1+ with MySQLi and Fileinfo enabled
- MySQL 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.4+
- XAMPP, or an equivalent PHP/MySQL environment

## Run with XAMPP

1. Place this folder at `C:\xampp\htdocs\mini-social`.
2. Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel.
3. Open phpMyAdmin at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` and import `sql/social_app.sql`.
4. Visit `http://localhost/mini-social/`.

The default local database connection is host `127.0.0.1`, database `social_app`, user `root`, and an empty password. Set `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASS` environment variables to override it.

The SQL file includes three demo accounts, posts, comments, and likes. Each demo account uses the password `commonplace123`.

The administrator uses username `admin` and password `MiniAdmin2026!`. The single SQL file also adds the admin role to an existing `users` table without deleting its data.

Uploaded images are limited to 5 MB and accepted only when their detected MIME type is JPEG, PNG, WEBP, or GIF. The application uses prepared statements, escaped template output, CSRF tokens for state-changing requests, password hashing, and ownership checks for post and comment edits/deletes.
